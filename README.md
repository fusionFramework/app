# Fusion Framework

<description>

## Installation

If you have composer installed go into the directory you want to install the framework to and run ```composer create-project fusionframework/app``` this should get you all the code.

Otherwise you can download and unzip this file : <link>

Now go and move ```fusion/core/config/database.php``` to ```application/config/database.php``` and fill in your database details.

Next, in the command line run ```php minion install```

It will ask you a few questions during the installation process, setup your database and create the first user.

Once that's done your application is ready to be uploaded.
